				However, it can be made focusable if necessary by adding attributes like tabindex="0". -->
<!-- Accessible Name: A <section> element can have an implicit ARIA role of "region" when it 
	has an accessible name. This name can be provided using a <h1>-<h6> heading element inside 
	the <section>, or by using attributes like aria-label or aria-labelledby.
		THUS USE SECTION BECAUSE IT HAS SEMANTIC MEANING BY USING THE HEADING ELEMENT ALWAYS IF POSSIBLE
		OR EVEN ARIA-LABEL WHICH DIV ALSO CAN USE -->
